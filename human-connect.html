        In terms of the Mastodon's connection to early humans, it has long been believed that the Mastodon was hunted to extinction by early humans, 
        with the Clovis tribe being the most famous in this regard. 
        This idea has even facilitated the notation that the Clovis people were big game hunters.

        We know that humans hunted down big game animals like the Mastodon thanks to these primitive tools pictured to the left.
        These are "Clovis Points" and they were found near the fossilized remains of big game animals.
        Since these Clovis Points have a flute near the bottom of the tool, it has been concluded that these points 
        were placed on the ends of sticks, creating spears.
        From there, it has been deduced that early humans like the Clovis threw and/or jabbed spears into these huge animals, then after they 
        killed and butchered the animal, they leave the points behind.
        These points would then get preserved and fossilized alongside the animals' remains.

    <p class="txtleft">
        However, the idea that the Clovis people were big game hunters have been contested in recent years. 
        Since the Clovis Points were multipurpose tools, the idea that they were used as points on a spear can not be determined with one hundred percent certainty.
        It is possible that the points were used as a butchering tool instead of a weapon.
        In addition, the Clovis people only ate what was easiest to get, so the idea that they specifically sought after big game animals like the Mastodon
        is a stretch.
